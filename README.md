# Transportation Network Visualization Tool
This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application developed in Racket that visualizes a transportation network map and calculates routes between stations. It was created as a group project for a university course.

##Features
*Graphical Representation:* The application provides a visual representation of a transportation network map, including stations and connections between them.
*Route Calculation:* Users can input starting and ending stations to find all possible routes between them. The application calculates the total cost and time for each route.
*User Interface:* The GUI includes input fields for selecting start and end stations, buttons for route calculation and resetting, and a display area for showing route information.

##Usage
*Starting the Application:* Run the Racket program to launch the GUI interface.
*Selecting Stations:* Enter the station numbers in the input fields to specify the start and end points for route calculation.
*Calculating Routes:* Click the "Calculate Routes" button to find all possible routes between the selected stations. The routes will be displayed along with their total cost and time.
*Resetting:* Use the "Reset" button to clear the input fields and reset the display.
*Exiting the Application:* Click the "Exit" button to close the application.
